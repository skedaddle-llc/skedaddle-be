        first and last 6 miles of this trail are on the gravel road that goes through
        Waterton Canyon, meaning your total off-road trail distance will be about
        17 miles (29 miles total).  Nonetheless, there is a lot of climbing and some
        route finding skills required, which means this ride has the potential to
        be MUCH longer than you anticipate.  If you carry a good map with you, there
        should be few problems.  If you grab the Trails Illustrated Map #135 for Deckers
        and Rampart Range, it has a blowup view of this entire trail system on the
        back and shows the loop almost perfectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br \/><br \/>The
        first 6 miles will take you up to the dam.  You will continue on up the fire
        road until it ends and changes into singletrack (beginning the Colorado Trail).  This
        will continue to climb for about another mile until you reach the bench at
        the top.  From here you will notice a trail spur on the left just before you
        reach the bench, heading uphill.  This begins a short, but intense climb to
        the next intersection which is about \u00ba mile or so from the bench.  At
        this intersection you will notice the trail going left (back to Waterton)
        or to the right (uphill) heading onto the Indian Creek Loop.  Begin climbing
        once again as the trail strives to get to the ridgeline for about the next
        half mile or so.  You will finally reach a steep, loose section of trail which
        goes straight up, then to the left.  Once you clear this nasty section, it
        levels off from there.  This will be the last of the really bad climbs for
        quite some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br \/><br \/>Now that you are on the
        ridgeline, the trail does some gentle uphills interspersed with slight descents.  Eventually
        you will roll off the east side of the hill and a quick, but steep descent
        puts you at a T intersection.  Note that the left trail is NOT on the trails
        illustrated map.  If you turn left into Stevens Gulch, this will take you
        down a fun, fast descent back towards the Roxborough Loop (make sure you make
        a left when you reach the homestead!).  If you turn right at this T, this
        will continue you on the journey towards the Indian Creek campground (the
        mid-way point of this ride).  Now, the trail becomes a fun downhill as it
        tracks down to the creek bed.  Once you reach that point, you will start to
        gradually go back up as you follow the creek for another mile or so.  This
        is a very scenic portion of the ride, and nice and cool in the shade of the
        forest.  There will be some tiring climbs as you get closer to the campground,
        but they are mostly just long grinds on easy terrain.  After a final little
        rock obstacle, you will be in the campground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br \/><br
        \/>From here, proceed to the latrine and potable water faucet.  You should
        see the clearly marked singletrack peeling off to the left, up the hill.  Once
        you refill your water, head back up the trail and begin another set of climbs.  Note
        that this section of trail is NOT on the trails illustrated map.  The grade
        here is pretty gentle, although you will be going uphill until you reach the
        fire road.  There will be several roads\/trails at this intersection, but
        only one should be marked with the Indian Creek signage (as you come off the
        singletrack, look straight across and to the left down the hill).  This next
        section is on a fire road, but it is fast and fun because most of it goes
        downhill from this point.  You will come to a few odd intersections, but the
        trail is well marked the whole way.  At one Y intersection there was some
        deliberation on our route because the sign has an arrow which points between
        the two roads\u00d6but at this point you want to go up to the left.  The left
        route was also well used in comparison to the right fork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br
        \/><br \/>As you get closer to the Roxborough State Park, beware of the huge
        \u00ecspeed bumps\u00ee someone has put in all along the trail.  These really
        are big jumps, but they are at odd intervals and around corners so they may
        take you by surprise if you aren\u00edt paying attention.  Because of their
        sharp angles, they are extremely dangerous to hit at even medium speed.  One
        guy in the group riding ahead of us broke his collarbone because he took these
        just slightly too fast. The fire road eventually begins to return to singletrack,
        especially once you reach the power lines.  At this point, you will get some
        incredible singletrack, blasting you through the forest as you cheer in delight.  You
        absolutely cannot miss the signage once you enter the State Park, but the
        singletrack generally continues along the creek bed here.  Your fun will end
        as you reach another tough climb out of the canyon (luckily it is rather short).  Your
        journey will go downhill again from here, and at one point you will come to
        an incredible meadow with just a ribbon of singletrack laid out before you.  If
        you can force yourself to stop, this is a great place for a snapshot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br
        \/><br \/>Once you reach the creek crossing, you will begin one more little
        set of climbs as you get ready to go back down into Waterton Canyon.  Once
        you start the downhill again, it doesn\u00edt let up until you are back down
        at the Waterton Canyon gravel road.  This section of trail is like a loose
        chute with lots of dust and loose rocks\u00d6but it can be a lot of fun as
        well.  There will be one intersection you pass with a trail going off to your
        left as you get back on the Roxborough Loop, but just continue straight downhill
        rather than making a left.  The signs all point you towards Waterton Canyon
        from here.  Once we popped out, we all agreed that despite the amount of climbing
        we suffered through, the payoff was well worth the effort.  I\u00edm not sure
        if there is any merit in doing the loop in the reverse direction, although
        it is worth mentioning that I can\u00edt recall passing anyone in all those
        miles going the opposite direction.  Also note this is an equestrian loop
        as well, so best practice is to dismount when you see horses, pull off the
        trail and be friendly to them.  ","directions":"Wadsworth Blvd south of C470

        at the Waterton Canyon gravel road.  This section of trail is like a loose
        chute with lots of dust and loose rocks\u00d6but it can be a lot of fun as
        well.  There will be one intersection you pass with a trail going off to your
        left as you get back on the Roxborough Loop, but just continue straight downhill
        rather than making a left.  The signs all point you towards Waterton Canyon
        from here.  Once we popped out, we all agreed that despite the amount of climbing
        we suffered through, the payoff was well worth the effort.  I\u00edm not sure
        if there is any merit in doing the loop in the reverse direction, although
        it is worth mentioning that I can\u00edt recall passing anyone in all those
        miles going the opposite direction.  Also note this is an equestrian loop
        as well, so best practice is to dismount when you see horses, pull off the
        trail and be friendly to them.  ","name":"Indian Creek Loop","rank":"0","rating":"4.56","thumbnail":"http:\/\/images.singletracks.com\/2010\/06\/P6190001-0.jpg","activity_type":"5","activity_type_name":"mountain
